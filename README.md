### Hey Github world!

- 👋  My name is Joey Niosi and I live just outside of New York City.

- 🎓 I'm a full stack developer, bibliophile and tech enthusiast thats always looking to improve my skillset and learn new technogies.

- 💻 I've got a passion for web development, so I spend most of my time improving my abilities with HTML, CSS, JavaScript|React, Python|Django.

- 👨‍🍳 A snippet on ME: 
    Im a family man before everything else, love spending time with my wife and two children. When I'm not coding, or hanging with the fam I can be found reading, running some         local trails while listening to a favorite podcast or tunes, or cooking up some tasty eats in the kitchen. I care greatly about equality and social justice. One day I want to     be in a position where I'm able to leverage my resources and privilege to help mentor under-supported and underrepresented people into promising careers in tech.
 
- 👀 I’m interested in a frontend web development role where I can work together with a team on a product and bring value right from the jump.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much about Blockchain, Solidity, and Next.js as I can fit into each day. 

- 🤝🏽 I’m looking to collaborate on open source non-profit web development projects.
